/*
 * anland_device.h — DRM-like userspace display device interface
 *
 * Unified foundation that every supported DE backend (KWin / Mutter / ...)
 * translates to, replacing the model where each backend carries its own
 * copy of the anland transport glue (and often its own protocol fork).
 *
 * It wraps the existing producer transport (display daemon +
 * libdisplay_producer) behind DRM semantics:
 *
 *   device            ↔ display_daemon connection (single producer session)
 *   connector/CRTC    ↔ screen_info (width/height/format/refresh_mhz)
 *   framebuffer/plane ↔ consumer-owned dmabuf set (MAX_BUFS = 8)
 *   atomic commit     ↔ consumer-driven selected index (shm) + buf_ready
 *   page flip         ↔ fence channel (one render-done message per frame)
 *   fence fd          ↔ set_render_fence + trigger_refresh (GPU-side sync)
 *   evdev             ↔ poll_input_event (touch/key/pointer/clipboard/...)
 *   DRM master        ↔ anland_device_open (single producer, daemon-enforced)
 *
 * The API deliberately mirrors drmMode* shapes so that:
 *   1. each DE backend shrinks to a thin shape-translation layer
 *      (no anland protocol / fallback / dmabuf knowledge needed);
 *   2. if a real virtual DRM device later becomes possible, backends keep
 *      working unchanged — only this interface's implementation swaps to a
 *      /dev/dri/cardN shim.
 *
 * Threading: same contract as the underlying transport. The frame path
 * (commit/pageflip/get_fb) and the input path (poll_input) may run on
 * different threads; the underlying libdisplay_producer already serializes.
