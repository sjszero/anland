/*
 * anland_scene_legacy.h — anland_scene backend over the LEGACY fullscreen transport.
 *
 * Bridges the layer/commit contract (anland_scene.h) onto the existing
 * anland_device fullscreen path, so a DE gets honest submit / presented /
 * released accounting on top of the transport that actually exists.
 *
 * ============================ SCOPE / LIMITS ============================
 * This adapter FLATTENS the scene. The legacy transport has exactly one output
 * fed by a rotating set of consumer-owned dmabufs; it has no notion of a window.
 * The DE composites its own layers into the output framebuffer (it already does)
 * and this adapter performs the flip.
 *
 * This is the INTENDED shape for the product, not a stopgap: one container hosts
 * one DE on one Android Surface, so the consumer needs exactly one output and
 * there is no per-window Surface to hand it.
 *
 * Therefore:
 *   - layer placement, z-order, opacity and damage are NOT transmitted to the
 *     consumer; they are validated and recorded by anland_scene only;
 *   - per-window Android Surfaces are OUT OF SCOPE for this adapter and for the
 *     product: the scene is a single full-output layer in practice, and no
 *     per-window Surface behaviour may be built on top of this adapter;
 *   - buffer_id is bookkeeping: it identifies the producer-side buffer the DE
 *     rendered into, and is what gets released. It is not an Android Surface id.
 *
 * What it DOES give the DE:
 *   - one stable contract (submit / presented / released) that every DE adapter
 *     speaks, allowing a future virtual DRM device implementation without
 *     changing the DE contract;
 *   - honest frame accounting: submit, flip and consumer acknowledgement are
 *     three distinct events, instead of one pageflip() call that claims success
 *     before the consumer has done anything;
 *   - reconnect handling that drops in-flight work and releases buffers.
 *
 * One frame may be in flight at a time (the transport's own back-pressure). A
 * submit while a frame is outstanding is rejected, which surfaces as
 * COMMIT_DROPPED(BACKEND_ERROR) to the DE.
 *
 * GPU FENCES
 *   The commit's acquire_fence_fd is forwarded to the consumer so SurfaceFlinger
 *   can wait GPU-side. Because the scene is flattened, every layer is composited
 *   into the SAME output buffer, so the adapter takes the first non-negative
 *   acquire fence it finds; attach the output buffer's fence to any one layer.
 *
 *   Do NOT also call anland_device_set_render_fence() directly while using this
 *   adapter: present() passes its own fence to the flip, which replaces whatever
 *   was stashed and would silently discard the direct one.
 * ========================================================================
