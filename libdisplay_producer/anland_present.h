/*
 * anland_present.h -- producer-side presentation lifecycle.
 *
 * This is an in-process C API, NOT another wire protocol. All WMs use the same
 * path: scene transactions -> device -> existing fullscreen producer transport.
 * The WM still composites the complete desktop into the consumer's output.
 * Layer identity and buffer lifetime do not imply per-window Android Surfaces.
 *
 * Future device transports belong behind this boundary, not in WM adapters.
