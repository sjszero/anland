/*
 * anland_scene_legacy.c — anland_scene backend over the legacy fullscreen transport.
 *
 * Read the SCOPE / LIMITS block in anland_scene_legacy.h first: this adapter
 * FLATTENS the scene onto the single-output legacy transport. That is the shape
 * the product needs (one container, one DE, one Android Surface); per-window
 * Surfaces are out of scope.
 *
 * Frame lifecycle mapped onto the legacy transport:
 *
 *   submit()   → accepted only while connected and with no frame outstanding;
 *                records the commit as PENDING. Never touches the device, and
 *                never calls back into the scene: submit() runs while the scene
 *                holds its lock, so re-entering would deadlock.
 *   present()  → drains any stale buffer-ready signal, then commits + flips the
 *                buffer the consumer selected. The commit becomes IN FLIGHT.
 *   pump()     → when the consumer raises buffer-ready again (it consumed the
 *                frame and wants the next buffer), the in-flight commit is
 *                reported PRESENTED. That is the only point where the frame is
 *                known to have reached the consumer.
 *
 * The stale-signal drain in present() is what keeps the accounting honest: the
 * consumer's handshake raises buffer-ready before the producer has ever flipped,
 * so without draining, the first pump() would report a frame as presented that
 * the consumer had not yet consumed.
